Using Day 1 as an example, Page 40 provides the information you need to know that your bearing for the day is 120°, and the readings you’re looking for on that day are 142° and 178°-214°. Now follow these three steps:\n1. Begin by aligning the red arm of the compass to point to the bearing of 120°.\n2. Now, look to see which letter 142° aligns with, and you will see it is the letter “E” from the word “ice” on the Compass Wheel. This letter is then to be recorded at the bottom of Page 40, which is already prefilled to confirm you’re on the right track.\n3. Repeat step 2, looking for the range from 178°-214°, and you’ll see this range aligns with the letter “IGHT” from the word “wright” on the Compass Wheel.\nDay 1 yields the word “EIGHT” to be used in your final phrase to conclude the episode.\nRepeat Steps 1-3 above for the remaining five days. You will get the following results:\nDay 1: E, IGHT\nDay 2: HU, N, D, R, E, D\nDay 3: M, I, LE, S\nDay 4: R, E, S, C, U, E\nDay 5: THE\nDay 6: C, R, EW\nThe concluding phrase for this leg of the journey is EIGHT HUNDRED MILES RESCUE THE CREW."
